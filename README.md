# S3 to GCS

s3-to-gcs is a lambda function that allows you to perform a one way file copy from an existing Amazon S3 bucket to an existing Google Cloud Storage Bucket.

## Prerequisites

### AWS Setup
1. Create IAM credentials in order to deploy the lambda function by following [this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)
2. Ensure that the S3 bucket is created

### Google Cloud Platform setup
1. Create a service account for the lambda function by following [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)
2. Create a set of access keys for the service account by following [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys). Make sure the key type is JSON.
3. Save the access key json file as `service-account.json` in the root folder of this repository (don't worry, it's already gitignored)
4. Assign "Legacy Bucket Writer" role to the GCS bucket for this service account
